# Advanced Testing Commands

The Wheels CLI provides advanced testing capabilities through integration with TestBox. These commands offer specialized test runners for different testing scenarios.

## Available Commands

### test:all - Run All Tests

```bash
wheels test:all
```

# With JUnit output
wheels test:coverage --format=json --outputDir=coverage-reports
```

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure

The standard test directory structure for Wheels applications:

```
tests/
├── specs/             # Main test directory (default for type=app)
│   ├── unit/          # Unit tests
│   │   ├── models/    # Model unit tests
│   │   ├── controllers/ # Controller unit tests
│   │   └── helpers/   # Helper unit tests
│   ├── integration/   # Integration tests
│   │   ├── workflows/ # User workflow tests
│   │   └── api/       # API integration tests
│   └── functions/     # Function-specific tests
└── results/           # Test results and reports
    └── coverage/      # Coverage reports
```

### Test Types

The `--type` parameter determines which test suite to run:

- **app** (default): Runs tests in `/wheels/app/tests` route, uses `tests/specs` directory
- **core**: Runs tests in `/wheels/core/tests` route, for framework tests

### Sample Tests

When you run `test:unit` or `test:integration` for the first time and the directories don't exist, sample test files are created automatically in the correct locations:
- Unit tests: `tests/specs/unit/SampleUnitTest.cfc`
- Integration tests: `tests/specs/integration/SampleIntegrationTest.cfc`

## Output Formats

All test commands support multiple output formats via the `--format` parameter:

- **txt** (default): Human-readable text output
- **json**: JSON format for parsing and automation
- **junit**: JUnit XML format for CI/CD integration
- **html**: HTML format for browser viewing

## Best Practices

1. **Organize Tests by Type**
   - Keep unit tests in `tests/specs/unit/`
   - Keep integration tests in `tests/specs/integration/`
   - Use subdirectories for better organization

2. **Use Labels for Test Organization**
   ```cfc
   it("should process payments", function() {
       // test code
   }).labels("critical", "payments");
   ```

3. **Set Coverage Thresholds**
   - Aim for at least 80% code coverage
   - Use `--threshold` to enforce minimum coverage

4. **Watch Mode for TDD**
   - Use `test:watch` during development
   - Keep tests running in a separate terminal

5. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Use `--format=junit` for CI systems
   - Generate coverage reports with `--coverageReporter=xml`

## Coverage Requirements

Code coverage requires FusionReactor 8.0+ to be installed and configured:

1. Install FusionReactor
2. Enable Code Coverage in FusionReactor settings
3. Restart your ColdFusion/Lucee server
4. Run `wheels test:coverage`

## Troubleshooting

### TestBox CLI Not Found

If you get an error about TestBox CLI not being installed:

```bash
box install testbox-cli
box reload
```

### No Tests Found

Make sure your test files:
- Are in the correct directory (`tests/specs/` or subdirectories)
- Have the `.cfc` extension
- Extend `wheels.Testbox`

### Coverage Not Working

If coverage shows as disabled:
- Verify FusionReactor is installed
- Check that Code Coverage is enabled in FusionReactor settings
- Ensure you've restarted the server after enabling coverage

### Test Routes Not Working

The test commands use these routes:
- App tests: `http://localhost:port/wheels/app/tests`
- Core tests: `http://localhost:port/wheels/core/tests`

Ensure these routes are accessible and properly configured.
