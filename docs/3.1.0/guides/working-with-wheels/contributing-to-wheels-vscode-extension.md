## Making Changes

### Adding New Snippets
1. Navigate to the appropriate snippet file in `/snippets/`
2. Add your snippet following the existing pattern:
   ```json
   "functionName": {
     "prefix": "functionName",
     "body": [
       "functionName(${1:param} = \"${2:value}\")"
     ],
     "description": "Function description"
   }
   ```

### Updating Function Documentation
1. Edit files in `/src/` directory
2. Update hover documentation and parameter information
3. Ensure examples are accurate and helpful

### Modifying Extension Configuration
1. Update `package.json` for:
   - Version numbers
   - New file type support
   - Activation events
   - Contribution points

## Testing Your Changes

### Local Testing
1. Open the extension directory in VS Code
2. Press `F5` to launch Extension Development Host
3. Test your changes in the new VS Code window
4. Verify:
   - Snippets work correctly
   - Hover documentation displays properly
   - Completions appear as expected
   - No errors in Developer Console

### Building and Testing VSIX
1. Package the extension:
   ```bash
   vsce package
   ```
2. Install the generated `.vsix` file locally
3. Test in a real world environment

## Code Quality Standards

### Snippet Guidelines

2. Update `package.json` version
3. Document changes in `CHANGELOG.md`
4. Tag releases appropriately

### Compatibility Testing
